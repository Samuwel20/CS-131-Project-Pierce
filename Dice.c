/*
 * Monopoly square probabilities.
 *
 * This program will use a simulation of many turns to find the probabilities
 * of landing on the different squares in Monopoly.  Two tables are printed
 * at the end.  One for the strategy of paying to get out of jail immediately
 * and the other is for the strategy of staying in as long as possible.  The
 * numbers are the probabilities that a player will end up on the gameboard
 * squares, which is somewhat different than the probability of landing on
 * squares.  Although one may land on the Go To Jail square, one never ends
 * up there.  A similar situation exists when landing on a Chance or Community
 * Chest square where there is a probability based on what card is chosen that
 * one will end up on a different square.
